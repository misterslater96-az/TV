# 📺 TV — Terminal IPTV Launcher (v4.3 FINAL)

TV is a fast, keyboard-driven IPTV launcher for Linux that runs entirely in the terminal using mpv.

It is built to be lightweight, responsive, and reliable, with a focus on direct playback and minimal overhead. TV uses publicly available IPTV playlists and local caching to provide quick access to live streams without background services or persistent processes.

Version **4.3 FINAL** represents the locked, stable release intended for long-term use.

## 🧩 What TV Does

- Launches live IPTV streams directly from the terminal
- Uses mpv for video playback
- Supports keyboard-based navigation
- Caches playlists and guide data locally
- Returns cleanly to menus after playback

## 🩹 Optional Patch

Some systems may experience early playback exits or unexpected returns to the main menu due to mpv exit behavior.

An optional one-paste patch is provided to address this issue if it occurs.  
If TV behaves correctly on your system, the patch is not required.
